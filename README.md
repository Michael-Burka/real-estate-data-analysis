# Real Estate Data Analysis Study Project

## Project Overview
This project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a data analyst. It involves in-depth analysis of real estate data sourced from Yandex Real Estate, encompassing apartment sale listings in St. Petersburg and nearby areas spanning multiple years. The primary objective of this study is to gain insights into determining the market value of real estate properties. The outcome of this research will contribute to the development of an automated system capable of identifying anomalies and fraudulent activities in real estate listings.

Each apartment listing for sale contains two distinct types of data. The first type is user-provided information, while the second type is automatically generated based on cartographic data. For instance, data such as the distance to the city center, airport, and other landmarks are autonomously retrieved from geoservices. Additionally, information on the number of parks and water bodies is populated without user input.

## The project involves the following key stages:

1. **Data Exploration**: Commencing with loading the dataset and conducting an initial examination to understand its structure and contents. This phase includes the creation of histograms for numerical columns to gain an overview of data distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Identifying and addressing missing values, optimizing data types, and addressing potential duplicates. This step is crucial for ensuring data integrity.

3. **Feature Engineering**: The creation of new informative features including the price per square meter, the day of the week and month of listing publication, the year of listing publication, floor type, and the distance to the city center in kilometers.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the influence of various parameters on the total property value. This phase involves creating insightful visualizations and identifying dependencies among different variables.

5. **Anomaly Detection**: Recognizing anomalies and artifacts within the data and implementing corrective measures to enhance the quality of analysis results.

6. **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizing pivot tables and statistical techniques to summarize the findings and draw meaningful conclusions from the research.

This study project provides a valuable opportunity to explore the world of data analysis, delve into data exploration techniques, and make informed, data-driven decisions.
